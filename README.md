# Logistic Regression From Scratch
* Logistic Regression model developed in python from scratch on a diabetes dataset - the algorithm itself is built solely with numpy and built-in Python modules;
* Developed in vector notation utilising numpy for a more efficient computational analysis;
* Includes a function to normalise the data (default only normalises the x-data), along with a function to include a regularisation term;
* Includes a script written in numpy to create and display a confusion matrix;
* Outputs a graph of the cost vs the number of iterations, along with the number of iterations it took to converge;
* Outputs accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Code and Resources Used
**Python Version:** 3.8

**Packages:** numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn (for splitting the data)
